  - Webpack w/ basic dev and prod configurations
  - Express development server; easily roll out a production enabled server of your own
  - Eslint w/ basic configs

###Usage###

This generator is to be used with **yo**.

###Credits###

>This generator is initially based on [@gaeron's](https://github.com/gaeron) awesome [react-transform-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate).

This project supports [Babel 6](https://github.com/babel/babel), with reference implementations of:

 **[babel-plugin-react-transform](https://github.com/gaearon/babel-plugin-react-transform)**. It can be used as a boilerplate for quickly getting a new project up and running with a few useful transforms:

* [**react-transform-hmr**](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr) - enables hot reloading react components
* [**react-transform-catch-errors**](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-catch-errors) - catches errors inside `render()`

For convenience they are packed in a single preset called [**react-transform-hmre**](https://github.com/danmartinez101/babel-preset-react-hmre) but you can make your own.

Syntax errors are displayed in an overlay using **[@glenjamin](https://github.com/glenjamin)**â€™s **[webpack-hot-middleware](https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware)**, which replaces Webpack Dev Server. This project **[does not](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/the-death-of-react-hot-loader-765fa791d7c4)** use React Hot Loader.
